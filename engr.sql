(1, 'a) Study this situation:\n<div style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; display: table-cell; width: 90%;"> #IMG1# Ann is in her car. She is on her way to work.\n\nShe <b>is driving</b> to work. \n\nThis means: she is driving now, at the time of speaking. \n\nThis is the <i>present continuous</i> tense: \n            \nI <b>am</b> (= l''m) ||\nhe/she/(it) <b>is</b> (= he''s etc.) ||\nwe/they/you <b>are</b> (= we''re etc.)  driving \n</div>\nWe use the present continuous when we talk about something which is happening at the time of speaking: \n            \n#tab#- Please don''t make so much noise. l<b>''m studying</b>. (<i>not</i> ''I study'')\n#tab#- ''Where is Margaret?'' ''She<b>''s having</b> a bath.''(<i>not</i> ''she has'') \n#tab#- Let''s go out now. It <b>isn''t raining</b> any more. \n#tab#- (at a party) Hello, Ann. <b>Are</b> you <b>enjoying</b> the party? (<i>not</i> ''do you enjoy'') \n\nb) We also use the present continuous when we talk about something which is happening around the time of speaking, but not necessarily exactly at the time of speaking. Study this example situation: \n\n#tab#- Tom and Ann are talking and drinking in a cafe. Tom says: ''l''<b>m reading</b> an interesting book at the moment. I''ll lend it to you when I''ve finished it.'' \n\nTom is not reading the book at the time of speaking. He means that he has begun the book and hasn''t finished it yet. He is in the middle of reading it. Here are some more examples: \n\n#tab#- Silvia <b>is learning</b> English at the moment. (<i>not</i> ''learns'') \n#tab#- Have you heard about Tom? He <b>is building</b> his own house. (<i>not</i> ''builds'') \n\nBut perhaps Silvia and Tom are not doing these things exactly at the time of speaking. \n\nc) We often use the present continuous when we talk about a period around the present. For example: <b>today</b>, <b>this season</b> etc.: \n\n#tab#-''You''<b>re working</b> hard today.'' ''Yes, I have a lot to do.'' \n#tab#- Tom <b>isn''t playing</b> football this season. He wants to concentrate on his studies. \n\nd) We use the present continuous when we talk about changing situations: \n\n#tab#- The population of the world <b>is rising</b> very fast. (<i>not</i> ''rises'') \n#tab#- <b>Is</b> your English <b>getting</b> better? (<i>not</i> ''does ... get'') \n\n', 1),
(2, 'a) Study this example situation: \n<div style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black; display: table-cell; width: 90%;"> #IMG1# Alex is a bus driver. But now he is asleep in bed. \nSo: \nHe is <i>not</i> driving a bus (he is asleep). \n\n<i>But</i>: He <b>drives</b> a bus. \n\nThis is the <i>present simple</i> tense: \n\nI/we/you/they <b>drive</b> \nhe/she/(it) <b>drives</b> \n</div>\nWe use the present simple to talk about things in general. We are not thinking only about the present. We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general. It is not important whether the tuition is happening at the time of speaking: \n#tab#- The earth <b>goes</b> round the sun. \n#tab#- Nurses <b>look</b> after patients in hospitals. \n#tab#- In Britain most of the shops <b>close</b> at 5.30 p.m. \n\nRemember that we <b>say he/she/it -s</b>. Don''t forget the <b>s</b>: \n#tab#- I <b>work</b> in a bank. Barry <b>works</b> in a shop. \n\nb) We use do/does to make questions and negative sentences: \n\n#tab#<b>do</b> I/we/you/they work?  \n#tab#<b>does</b> he/she/it work?\n\n#tab#I/we/you/they <b>don''t</b> work  \n#tab#he/she/it <b>doesn''t</b> work\n\n#tab#- Excuse me, <b>do</b> you <b>speak</b> English? \n#tab#- ''Would you <b>like</b> a sigarette?'' ''No, thanks. I don''t smoke.'' \n#tab#- <b>What does</b> this word mean? (<i>not</i> ''What means this word?) \n#tab#- Rice <b>doesn''t grow</b> in Britain. \n\nFor questions see also Unit 49. \n\nc) We use the present simple when we say how often we do things: \n#tab#- I <b>get</b> up at 8 o''clock every morning. (<i>not</i> ''am getting'') \n#tab#- <b>How often do</b> you go to the dentist? \n#tab#- Ann <b>doesn''t often drink</b> tea. \n#tab#- In summer Tom <b>usually plays</b> tennis <b>twice a week</b>. \n\nd) Note that we say ''Where <b>do</b> you <b>come</b> from?''(= Where are you from?):\n#tab#- Where <b>do</b> you <b>come</b> from? (<i>not</i>'' Where are you coming from?) \n#tab#- He <b>comes</b> from Japan. (<i>not</i> ''He is coming from Japan.'') \n\ne) When you make a suggestion, you can say <b>Why don''t you ...?:</b> \n#tab#- ''l''m tired.'' ''Why don''t you go to bed early?''\n\n', 2),

(4, 'A) We use continuous forms for actions and heppening that have started but not finished (they <b>are eating</b> / it <b>is raining</b> etc.). Some verbs (for example, <b>know</b> and <b>like</b> are not normally used in this way, We don''t say ''I am knowing'' or ''they are thinking''; we say ''<b>I know</b>'', ''they <b>like</b>'')\n\nThe following verbs are not normally used in the present continuous:<b>\nlike &nbsp; love  &nbsp;  hate &nbsp; want &nbsp; need &nbsp; prefer\nknow &nbsp; realise &nbsp; suppose &nbsp; mean &nbsp; understand &nbsp; believe &nbsp; remember\nbelong &nbsp; fit &nbsp; contain &nbsp; consist &nbsp; seem \n</b>\n#tab# I''m hungry, <b>I want</b> something to eat. (<i>not</i> <b>I''m wanting</b>)\n#tab# <b>Do</b> you <b>understand</b> what <b>I mean</b>.\n#tab# Any <b>doesn''t seem</b> very happy at the moment.\n\nB) <b>Think</b>\nWhen <b>think</b> means ''belive'' or ''have an opinion'', we do not use the continuous:\n#tab# <b>I think</b> Marie is Canadian, but I''m not sure. (<i>not</i> <b>I''m thinking</b>)\n#tab# What <b>do</b> you <b>think</b> about my plan? (= <b>What</b> is your opinion?)\n\nWhen <b>think</b> means ''consider'', the continuous is possible:\n#tab# <b>I''m thinking</b> about what happened. I often  <b>think</b> about it.\n#tab# Nicky <b>is thinking</b> of giving up her job. (= she is considering it)\n\nC) <b>He is selfish</b> and <b>He is being selfish</b>\nHe<b>''s being</b> = He''s behaving / He''s acting. Compare:\n#tab# I can''t understand why he''<b>s being</b> so selfish. He isn''t usually like that.\n#tab# (<b>being</b> selfish = behaving selfishly at the moment)\n\n#tab# He never think about other people. He is very selfish. (<i>not</i> <b>He is being</b>)\n#tab# (= He is selfish generally, not only at the moment)\n\nWe use <b>am/is/are being</b> to say hoe somebody is <i>behaving</i>. It is not usually possible in other sentances:\n#tab# It''s hot today. (<i>not</i> It is being hot)\n#tab# Sarah is very tired. (<i>not</i> She is being tired)\n\nD) <b>See hear smell taste</b>\nWe normally use the present simple (not continuous) with these verbs:\n#tab# <b>Do</b> you <b>see</b> that man over there? (<i>not</i> Are you seeing)\n#tab# This room <b>smells</b>, Let''s open a window.\n\nWe often use <b>can + see/hear/smell/taste</b>\n#tab# <b>I can hear</b> a strange noise. <b>Can</b> you <b>hear</b> it?\n\nE) <b> Look feel</b>\nYou can use the present simple or continuous to say how somebody looks or feels now:\n#tab# You <b>look</b> well today. <i>or</i> You''<b>re looking</b> well today.\n#tab# How <b>do</b> you <b>feel</b> now? <i>or</i> How <b>are</b> you <b>feeling</b> now?\n<i>but</i>\n#tab# I usually <b>feel</b> tired in the morning.

(<i>not</i> What did you at the weekend?)\n#tab# I <b>didn''t do</b> anything. (<i>not</i> I didn''t anythig)\n\nD) The past of <b>be</b> (<b>am</b>/<b>is</b>/<b>are</b>) is <b>was</b>/<b>were</b>:\n\nI / he/she / it <b>was / wasn''t</b> #tab# <b>was</b> I / he/she /it?\nwe / you / they <b>were / weren''t</b> #tab# <b>were</b> we / you / they?\n\nNote that we do not use <b>did</b> in negatives and the questions with <b>was/were</b>:\n#tab# I <b>was</b> angry because they <b>were</b> late.\n#tab# <b>Was</b> the wether good when you <b>were</b> on holiday?\n#tab# They <b>weren''t</b> able to come because they <b>were</b> so busy.\n#tab# <b>Did</b> you go out last night or <b>were</b> you too tired?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Past simple and pst continuous: </b><a href=''/mvc_three/murphy/unit/6''>Unit 6</a> \n<b>Past simple and present perfect: </b><a href=''/mvc_three/murphy/unit/12''>Unit 12</a>  <a href=''/mvc_three/murphy/unit/13''>Unit 13</a> <a href=''/mvc_three/murphy/unit/14''>Unit 14</a>\n\n\n', 5),

The past participle often ends in -<b>ed</b> (finish<b>ed</b>, decid<b>ed</b> etc.), but many important verbs are <i>irregular</i> (<b>lost / done / written </b> etc.).\n\nB) When we say that ''something <b>has happened</b>'', this is usually new information:\n#tab# Ow! <b>I''ve cut</b> my finger.\n#tab# The road is closed. There <b>has been</b>  (there''s been) an accident.\n#tab# <i>(from the news)</i> Police <b>have arrested</b> two men in connection with the robbery.\n\nWhen we use the present perfect, there is a connection with <i>now</i>. The action in the past has a result <i>now</i>:\n#tab#  ''Where''s your key?'' ''I don''t know. I<b>''ve lost</b> it.'' (= I don''t have it <i>now</i>)\n#tab# He told me his name, but I''<b>ve forgotten</b> it. (= I can''t remember it <i>now</i>)\n#tab# ''Is Sally here?'' ''No, she''<b>s gone</b> out.''

Can you wait for me?\n\n#tab# This cheese looks horrible. I''<b>m not going to eat</b> it.  \n\n\nB) <b>I''m doing</b> and <b>I''m going to do</b>\n\nWe use <b>I am doing</b> (<i>present continuous</i>) when we say what we have <i>arranged</i> to do - for example, arranged to meet somebody, arranged to do something:\n\n#tab# What time <b>are</b> you <b>meeting</b> Ann this evening?\n#tab# I''<b>m leaving</b> tomorrow. I''ve got my plane ticket.\n\n<b>I''m going to do</b> something = I''ve decided to do it (but perhaps not <i>arranged</i> to do it):\n\n#tab# ''Your shoes are dirty.'' ''Yes, I know. I''<b>m going to clear</b> them.'' (= I''<b>ve decided</b> to clear them, but I haven''t <i>arranged</i> to clear them)\n#tab# I''ve decided not to stay here any longer. Tomorrow I''<b>m going to look</b> for somewhere else to stay.\n\nOften the difference is very small and either form is possible.\n\n\nC) You can also say that ''something <b>is going to happen</b>'' in the future. For example:\n\nThe man can''t see the wall in front of him.\nHe <b>is going to walk</b> into the wall.\n\nWhen we say that ''something <b>is going to happen</b>'', the situation <i>now</i> makes it clear. The man is walking toward the wall now, so we can see that he <b>is going to walk</b> into it.\n\nSome more examples:\n#tab# Look at those black clouds! It''<b>s going to rain</b>.\n#tab# I feel terrible. I think I''<b>m going to be</b> sick. (I feel terrible now)\n#tab# The economic situation is bad now and things <b>are going to get</b> worse.\n\n\nD)  <b>I was going to</b> (do something) = I intended to do it, but didn''t do it:\n\n#tab# We <b>were going to travel</b> by train, but we decided to go by car instead,\n#tab# Peter <b>was going to do</b> the exam, but he changed his mind.\n#tab# I <b>was</b> just <b>going to cross</b> the road when somebody shouted ''Stop!''\n\nYou can say that ''somebody <b>was going to happen</b>'' (but didn''t happen):\n#tab# I thought it <b>was going to rain</b>, but it didn''t.\n\n\n \n', 20),
(21, 'A) We use <b>I''ll</b> ( I will ) when we decide to do something at the time of speaking:\n\n#tab# Oh, I''ve left the door open. <b>I''ll go</b> and shut it.\n#tab# ''What would you like to drinlk?'' ''<b>I''ll have</b> an orange juice, please.''\n#tab# ''Did you phone Lucy?'' ''Oh no, I forgot. <b>I''ll phone</b> her now.''\n\nYou cannot use the <i>present simple</i> (<b>I do</b>) in these sentences:\n#tab# I<b>''ll go</b> and shut the door. (<i>not</i> I go shut)\n\nWe often use <b>I think I''ll</b> ... and <b>I don''t think I''ll</b>...:\n#tab# I feel a bit hungry. <b>I think I''ll</b> have something to eat.\n#tab# <b>I don''t think I''ll go</b> out tonight. I''m too tired.\n\n\nB) Do <i>not</i> use <b>will</b> to talk about what you have already decided or arranged to do:\n#tab# <b>I''m going</b> on holiday next Saturday, (<i>not</i> I''ll go)\n#tab# <b>Are</b> you <b>working</b> tomorrow? (<i>not</i> Will you work)\n\n\nC) We often use <b>will</b> in these situations:\n\n#tab# <i>Offering to do something</i>\n#tab# That bag looks heavy. <b>I''ll help</b> you with it. (<i>not</i> I help)\n\n#tab# <i>Agreeing to do something</i>\n#tab# A: Can you give Tim this book?\n#tab# B: Sure, <b>I''ll give</b> it to him when I see him this afternoon.\n\n#tab# <i>Promising to do something</i>\n#tab# Thanks for lending me the money. <b>I''ll pay</b> you back on Friday.\n#tab# <b>I won''t tell</b> anyone what happened. I promise.\n\n#tab# <i>Asking somebody to do something</i> (<b>Will you</b>...?)\n#tab# <b>Will you</b> please turn the stereo down? I''m trying to concentrate.\n\n<hr />\n\nYou can use <b>won''t</b> to say that somebody refuses to do something:\n#tab# I''ve tried to give her advice, but she <b>won''t listen</b>.\n#tab# The car <b>won''t start</b>. (= the car ''refuses'' to start)\n\nD) <b>Shall I</b>...? <b>Shall we</b>...?\n\n<b>Shall</b> is used mostly in the questions <b>shall I / we</b>...?\nWe use <b>shall I / we</b>...? to ask somebody''s opinion (especially in offers or suggestions):\n\n#tab# <b>Shall I</b> open the window? (= Do you want to open the window?)\n#tab# I''ve got no money. What <b>shall I</b> do? (= What do you suggest?)\n#tab# ''<b>Shall we</b> go?'' ''Just a minutes. I''m not ready yet.''\n#tab# Where <b>shall we</b> go this evening?\n\nCompare <b>shall I</b>...? and <b>will you</b>...?:\n#tab# <b>Shall I</b> shut the door? (= Do you want me to shut it?)\n#tab# <b>Will you</b> shut the door? (= I want you to shut it)\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n ', 21),
(22, 'A) We do <i>not</i> use <b>will</b> to say what somebody has already arranged or decided to do:\n\n#tab# DIane <b>is working</b> next week. ( <i>not</i> Diane will work )\n#tab# <b>Are</b> you <b>going to watch</b> TV this evening? ( <i>not</i> Will you watch )\n\nBut often, when we talk about the future, we are <i>not</i> talking about what somebody has decided to do.\nFor example:\n<i>Kate is doing an exam next week. Chris and Joe are talking about it</i>\n\n#tab# Chris: Do you think Kate <b>will pass</b> the exam?\n#tab# Joe: Yes, she''<b>ll pass</b> easily.\n\n<b> She''ll pass</b> does <i>not</i> mean ''she has decided to pass''. Joe is saying what he knows or thinks will happen.\nHe is <i>predicting</i> the future.\nWhen we predict a future happening or situations, we use <b>will/won''t</b>.\n\nSome more examples:\n#tab# Jill has been away a long time, When she returns, she''<b>ll find</b> a lot of changes here.\n#tab# ''Where <b>will</b> you <b>be</b> this time time next year?'' ''I''<b>ll be</b> in Japan.''\n#tab# That plate  is hot. If you touch it, you''<b>ll burn</b> yourself.\n#tab# Tom <b>won''t pass</b> the exam. He hasn''t studied hard enough,\n#tab# When <b>will</b> you <b>get</b> your exam results?\n\n\nB) We often use <b>will</b> with:\n\n<b>probably</b>&nbsp; #tab# I''<b>ll probably</b> be home late tonight.\n<b>I exepct</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; #tab# I haven''t seen Carol today. <b>I expect</b> she''<b>ll</b> phone this evening.\n<b>(I''m) sure</b> #tab# Don''t worry about the exam. <b>I''m sure</b> you''<b>ll</b> pass.\n<b>(I) think </b> #tab# Do you <b>think</b> Sarah <b>will</b> like the preent we boght her?\n<b> I don''t think</b> #tab# I <b>don''t think</b> the exam <b>will</b> be very difficult.\n<b>I wonder</b> #tab# <b>I wonder</b> what <b>will</b> happen.\n\nAfter <b>I hope</b>, we generally use the present (<b>will</b> is also possible):\n#tab# I hope Kate <b>passes</b> the axam. (<i>or</i> I hope Kate <b>will pass</b>...)\n#tab# I hope it doesn''t rain tomorrow.\n\n\nC) Generally we use <b>will</b> to talk about the future, but sometimes we use <b>will</b> to talk about <i>now</i>.\nFor example:\n#tab# Don''t phone Ann now. She''<b>ll be</b> busy. (= she''ll be busy now)\n\n\nD) <b>I shall</b>,,, / <b>we shall</b>...\n\nNormally we use <b>shall</b> only with <b>I</b> and <b>we</b>. You can say:\n\n#tab# <b>I shall</b> <i>or</i> <b>I will (I''ll)</b> <b>we shall</b> <i>or</i> <b>we will (we''ll)</b> \n#tab# <b>I shall</b> be late this evening. (<i>or</i> I will be)\n#tab# <b>We shall</b> probably go to Scotland in this summer. (<i>or</i> We will probably go)\n\nThe negative of <b>shall</b> is <b>shall not</b> or <b>shan''t</b>:\n#tab# I <b>shan''t</b> be here tomorrow. (<i>or</i> <b>I won''t</b> be)\n\nDo not use <b>shall</b> with <b>he/she/it/they</b>:\n#tab# She <b>will</b> be very angry. (<i>not</i> She shall be)\n\n \n\n\n', 22),
(23, 'A) Future actions\n\nStudy the difference between <b>will</b> and <b>(be) going to</b>:\n\nSue is talking to Helen:\n#tab# Sue: Let''s have a party.\n#tab# Helen: That''s a great idea. We''ll invite lots of people.\n\n<i><b>will (''ll)</b>: We use <b>will</b> when we decide to do something at the time os fpeaking. The speaker has not decided before. The party is a new idea.</b></i>\n\nLater that day, Helen meets Dave:\n#tab# Helen: Sue and I have decided to have  a party, We''<b>re going to </b> invite lots of people.\n\n<i><b>(be) going to</b>: We use <b>(be) going to</b> when we have <u>already decided</u> to do something. Helen had already decided to invite lots of people before she spoke to Dave.</b></i>\n\n\nB) Future happenings and situations (predicting the future)\n\nSometimes there is not much difference between <b>will</b> and <b>going to</b>. For example:\n#tab# I think the weather <b>will</b> be nice this afternoon.\n#tab# I think the weather <b>is going to</b> be nice this afternoon.\n\nWhen we say something <b>is going to</b> happen, we think is because of the situation <i>now</i>. For example:\n\n#tab# Look at those black clouds. It''<b>s going to</b> rain. (<i>not</i> it will rain)\n#tab# I feel terrible. I think I''<b>m going to</b> be sick. (<i>not</i> I think I''ll be sick)\n\nIn other situations, use <b>will</b>: \n#tab# Tom <b>will</b> probably <b>get</b> here at about   o''clock.\n#tab# I think Sarah <b>will like</b> the present we bought for her.\n#tab# These shoes are very well-made, They''<b>ll last</b> a long time.\n\n\n', 23),
(24, 'A) Study this example situation:\n\nThe people are stading in a queue to get into the cinema.\n\nHalf an hour from now, the cinema will be full.\nEveryone <b>will be watching</b> the filn.\n\nThree hours from now, the cinema will be empty.\nThe film <b>will have finished</b>.\nEverybody <b>will have gone</b> home.\n\n\nB) <b>I will be doing</b> something (<i>future continuous</i>) = I will be in the middle of doing it:\n#tab# This time next week I''ll be on holiday. I''<b>ll be lying</b> on the beach or <b>swimming</b> in the sea.\n#tab# You have no chance of getting the job. You''<b>ll be wasting</b> of time if you apply for it.\n\nCompare <b>will be</b> (do)<b>ing</b>  and <b>will</b> (do):\n#tab# Don''t phone between 7and 8. We''<b>ll be having</b> dinner.\n#tab# Let''s wait for Liz to arrive and then we''<b>ll have</b> dinner.\n\nCompare <b>will be -ing</b> with other continuous forms:\n#tab# At 10 o''clock yestarday, Sally <b>was</b> in her office. She <b>was working</b>, (<i>past</i>)\n#tab# At 10 o''clock now, Sally <b>is</b> in her office. She <b>is working</b>, (<i>present</i>)\n#tab# At 10 o''clock tomorrow, Sally <b>will be</b> in her office. She <b>will be working</b>, \n\n\nC) We also use <b>will be -ing</b> in a different way: to talk about complete actions in the future.\nFor example:\n#tab# The govertment <b>will be making</b> a statement about the crisis later today.\n#tab# <b>Will</b> you <b>be going</b> away this summer?\n#tab# Later in the programme, I''<b>ll be talking</b> to the Minister of Education,,,\n#tab# Our best player is injured and <b>won''t be playing</b> in the game on Saturday,\n\n\nD) We use <b>will have (done)</b> (<i>future perfect</i>) to say something will already be complete before a time in the future. For example:\n#tab# Sally always leaves for work at 8.30 in the morning. She won''t be at home at 9 o''clock - she''<b>ll have gone</b> ot work.\n#tab# We''re late, The film <b>will</b> already <b>have started</b> by the time we get to the cinema.\n\nCompare <b>will have</b> (done) with other perfect forms:\n#tab# Ted and Amy <b>have been</b> married for 24 years, (<i>present perfect</i>)\n#tab# Next year they <b>will have been</b> married for 25 years.\n#tab# When their son was born, they <b>had been</b> marrried for three years, (<i>past perfect</i>)\n\n\n\n ', 24),
(25, 'A) Study this situation:\n\nA: Will you phone me tommorow?\nB: Yes, I''ll phone you <b>when I get</b> home from work.\n\n''I''ll phone you when I get home'' is a sentence with two parts:\n#tab# <i>the main part</i>: ''I''ll phone you''\nand <i>the <b>when</b>-part</i>: ''<b>when I get</b> home''\n\nThe time in the sentence is future (''tomorrow''), but we use a <i>present tense</i> (<b>I get</b>) in the <b>when</b>-part of the sentence.\n\nWe do <i>not</i> use <b>will</b> in the <b>when</b>-part of the sentence.\n\n\nSome more examples:\n#tab# We''<b>ll go</b> out <b>when</b> it <b>stops</b> raining. (<i>not</i> when it will stop)\n#tab# <b>When</b> you <b>are</b> London again, come and see us. (<i>not</i> When you will be)\n#tab# (<i>said to child</i>) What do you want to be <b>when</b> you <b>grow</b> up? (<i>not</i> will grow)\n\nThe same thing happens after:\n#tab# <b>while\n#tab# before\n#tab# after\n#tab# as soon as\n#tab# until\n#tab# till </b>\n \n#tab# I''m going to read a lot <b>while I''m</b> on holiday, (<i>not</i> while I will be)\n#tab# I''ll probably go back home on Sunday. <b>Before I go</b>, I''d like to visit the museum.\n#tab# Wait here <b>until</b> (<i>or</i> <b>till</b>) I <b>come</b> back.\n\n\nB) You can also use the present perfect (<b>have done</b>) after <b>when / after / until / as soon as</b>:\n#tab# Can I borrow that book <b>when</b> you''<b>ve</b> finished it?\n#tab# Don''t say anything while Ian is here. Wait <b>until</b> he <b>has gone</b>,\n\nIf you use the present pefect, one thing must be complete <i>before</i> the other (so the two things do <i>not</i> happen together):\n#tab# <b>When I''ve phoned</b> Kate, we can have dinner,\n#tab# (= First I''ll phone Kate and <i>after that</i> we can have dinner)\n\nDo not use the present perfect if two things happen together:\n#tab# <b>When</b> I <b>phone</b> Kate, I''ll ask her about the party. (<i>not</i> When I''ve phoned)\n\nIt is often possible to use either the present simple or present perfect:\n#tab# I''ll come <b>as soon as I finish</b>. \n<i>or</i> \n#tab# I''ll come <b>as soon as I''ve finished.</b>\n\n#tab# You''ll feel better <b>after</b> you <b>have</b> something to eat.\n<i>or</i>\n#tab# You''ll feel better <b>after</b> you<b>''ve had</b> something to eat.\n\n\nC) After <b>if</b>, we normally use the present simple (<b>if I do / if I see</b> etc.) for the tuture:\n#tab# It''s raining hard. We''ll get wet <b>if</b> we <b>go></b> out, (<i>not</i> if we will go)\n#tab# I''ll be angry <b>if</b> it <b>happens</b> again. (<i>not</i> if it will happen)\n#tab# Hurry up! <b>If</b> we <b>don''t hurry</b>, we''ll be late.\n\n\nD) Compare <b>when</b> and <b>if</b>:\n\nWe use <b>when</b> for things wich are <i>sure</i> to happen:\n#tab# I''m going shopping later. (for sure) <b>When</b> I go shopping, I''ll buy some food.\n\nWe use <b>if</b> (<i>not</i> when) for things that will <i>possibly</i> happen:\n#tab# I might go shopping later. (it''s possible) <b>If</b> I go shopping, I''ll buy some food.\n#tab# <b>If</b> it is raining this evening, I won''t go out. (<i>not</i> When it is raining)\n#tab# Don''t worry <b>if</b> I''m late tonight. (<i>not</i> when I''m late)\n#tab# <b>If</b> they don''t come soon, I''m not going to wait. (<i>not</i> When they don''t come)\n\n\n', 25),
(26, 'A) We use <b>can</b> to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has ability to do something, We use <b>can</b> + <i>infinitive</i> (can do, can see etc.):\n#tab# We <b>can see</b> the lake from our bedroom window.\n#tab# ''I haven''t got a pen.'' ''You <b>can use</b> mine.''\n#tab# <b>Can</b> you <b>speak</b> any foriegn languages?\n#tab# I <b>can come</b> and see you tomorrow if you like.\n#tab# The word ''play'' <b>can be</b> a noun or a varb.\n\nThe negative is <b>can''t</b> (= cannot):\n#tab# I''m afraid I <b>can''t come </b> to the party on Friday.\n\n\nB) You can say that somebody <b>is able to do</b> something, but <b>can</b> is more usual:\n#tab# We <b>are able to see</b> the lake from our bedroom window.\n\nBut <b>can</b> has only two forms: <b>can</b> (<i>present</i>) and <b>could</b> (<i>past</i>). So sometimes it is necessary to use <b>(be) able to</b>. Compare:\n#tab# I <b>can''t</b> sleep. I <b>haven''t been able to sleep</b> recently.\n#tab# Tom <b>can</b> come tomorrow. Tom <b>might be able to</b> come tomorrow.\n#tab# Maria <b>can</b> speak French, Spanish and English. Applicants for the job <b>must be able to</b> speak two foregn languages.\n\n\nC) <b>Could</b>\n\nSometimes <b>could</b> is the past of <b>can</b>.

We <b>could</b> see the lake.\n#tab# As soon as I walked into the room, I <b>could smell</b> gas.\n#tab# I was sitting at the back of the theatre and <b>couldn''t hear</b> very well.\n\nWe also use <b>could</b> to say that somebody had the general ability or permission to do something:\n#My grandfather <b>could speak</b> five languages.\n#tab# We were totaly free. We <b>could do</b> what we wanted. (= we were allowed to do)\n\n\nD) <b>Could</b> and <b>was able to</b>\n\nWe use <b>could</b> for <i>general</i> ability. But if you want to say that somebody did something in a specific situation, use <b>was/were able to</b> or <b>managed to</b> (<i>not</i> <b>could</b>) :\n\n#tab# The fire spread throght the building very quickly, but everybody <b>was able to escape / managed to escape</b>. (<i>not</i> could escape)\n#tab# We didn''t know where David was, but we <b>managed to find / were able to find</b> him in the end.

(= he meneged to beat him in this particular game)\n\n\nThe negative <b>couldn''t (could not) </b> is possible in all situations:\n#tab# My grandfather <b>couldn''t swim</b>.\n#tab# We looked for David everywhere, but we <b>couldn''t find</b> him.\n#tab# Pete played well, but he <b>couldn''t beat</b> Mike,\n\n\n', 26),
(27, 'A) We use <b>could</b> in a number of ways. Sometimes <b>could</b> is the past of <b>can</b>:\n#tab# Listen, I <b>can hear</b> something. (<i>now</i>)\n#tab# I listened. I <b>could hear</b> something. (<i>past</i>)\n\nBut <b>could</b> is not only used in this way. We also use <b>could</b> to talk about possible actions <i>now</i> or <i>in the future</i> (especially to make suggestions).\nFor example:\n#tab# A: What shall we do this evening?\n#tab# B: We <b>could go</b> to the cinema.\n\n#tab# A: When you go Paris next month, you <b>could stay</b> with Julia.\n#tab# B: Yes, I suppose I <b>could</b>.\n\n<b>Can</b> is also possible in these sentences (''We <b>can</b> go the cinema.'' etc.). With <b>could</b>, the suggestion\n\n\nB) We also use <b>could</b> (<i>not</i> <b>can</b>) for action which are not realistic. \nFor example:\n#tab# I''m so tired, I <b>could sleep</b> for a week.

He <b>could have hurt</b> himself when he fell, but he is OK.\n\n\nE) We use <b>couldn''t</b> to say that something would not be possible now:\n#tab# I <b>couldn''t live</b> in a big city. I''d hate it. (= it wouldn''t be possible for me)\n#tab# Everything is fine right now. Things <b>couldn''t be</b> better.\n\nFor the past we use <b>couldn''t have</b> (done):\n#tab# We had a really good holiday.

I <b>must phone</b> her. (= I say necessary)\n#tab# Mark is a realy nice person. You <b>must meet</b> him (I recomended this)\n\nWe use <b>have to</b> (<i>nota</i> <b>must</b>) to say what someone is <i>obliged</i> to do.

We <b>needn''t</b> hurry.\n#tab# (= it is not necessary to hurry)\n\n\nB) Istead of <b>needn''t</b>, you can use <b>don''t/doesn''t need to</b>. So you can say:\n#tab# We needn''t hurry. <i>or</i> We <b>don''t need to</b> hurry.\n\nRemember that we say <b>don''t need to do</b>, but <b>needn''t do</b> (<i>without</i> <b>to</b>). \n\n\nC) <b>Needn''t have</b> (done)\n\nStudy this example situation:\n\nPaul had to go out. He thought it was going to rain, so he took the umbrella:\n- I think it''s going to rain. I''ll take the umbrella.\n\n<i>later</i>\n\nBut it didn''t rain, so the umbrella was not necessary. So <b>he needn''t have taken</b> it.\n- I <b>needn''t have taken</b> the umbrella.\n\nHe <b>needn''t have taken</b> the umbrella. = He took the umbrella, but was not necessary.\n\nCompare <b>needn''t</b> (do) and <b>needn''t have</b> (done):\n#tab# Everything will be OK. You <b>needn''t worry</b>. (it''s not necassary)\n#tab# Everything was OK. You <b>needn''t have worried</b>. (you worried, but it was not necassary)\n\n\nD) <b>Didn''t need to</b> (do) and <b>needn''t have</b> (done)\n\nI <b>didn''t need to</b> ... = it was not necassary for me to...

It <b>should be</b> $2.50, not $3.50.\n#tab# That man on the motorbike <b>should be wearing</b> s helmet.\n\nWe also use <b>should</b> to say we expect something to happen:\n#tab# She''s been studing hard for the exam, so she <b>should pass</b>. (I expect her to pass)\n#tab# There are plenty of hotels in the town. It <b>shouldn''t be</b> difficult to find somewhere to stay. (I don''t expect it to be difficult)\n\n\nC) You <b>should have done</b> something = you didn''t do it, but it would have been the right thing to do:\n#tab# You missed a great party last night.

You <b>should have gone</b> to bed ealier.\n\n\nD) <b>Ought to ... </b>\nYou can use <b>ought to</b> instead of <b>should</b> in the senteces on this page.

It is the same as the <i>infiniteve</i> (without to).\nYou can also use normal present and past tenses:\n#tab# It''s <b>essential</b> that everybody <b>is</b> here on time.\n#tab# I <b>demanded</b> that he <b>apologised</b>.\n\nAfter <b>suggest</b>, you cannot use <b>to</b> ... (''to do / to buy'' etc.). You can say:\n#tab# What do you <b>suggest</b> we <b>should do</b>?\n<i>or</i>#tab# What do you <b>suggest we do</b>?

For example:\n#tab# <b>If</b> Tom <b>should phone</b> while I''m out, tell him I''ll call him back later.\n\n''<b>If</b> Tom <b>should phone</b>'' is similar to ''<b>If</b> Tom <b>phones</b>''. With <b>should</b>, the speaker feels that the possibility is smaller. Another exampple:\n\n#tab# We have no jobs at present. But <b>if</b> the situation <b>should change</b>, we''ll let you know.\n\nYou can also begin these sentences with <b>should</b> (<b>Should</b> something happen...):\n#tab# <b>Should</b> Tom <b>phone</b>, tell him I''ll call him back later.\n\n \nE) You can use <b>I should ... / I shouldn''t ... </b> to give somebody advise. For example:\n#tab# ''Shall I leave now?'' ''No, <b>I should</b> wait a bit longer.''\n\nHere, <b>I should wait</b> = I would wait if I were you, I advise you to wait.\nTwo more examples:\n#tab# ''I''m going out now. Is it cold?''

I''ve got a lot of to do.''\n#tab# You don''t look wery well. <b>You''d better not go</b> to work today.\n\nRemember that:\n\nThe form is ''<b>had</b> better'' (usually I''d better / you''d better etc. in spoken English).\n#tab# I''<b>d better</b> phone Carol, <b>hadn''t</b> I?\n\n<b>Had</b> is normally past, but the meaning of <b>had better</b> is present or future, <i>not</i> past.\n#tab# I''<b>d better go</b>  to the bank <b>now / tomorrow</b>.\n\nWe say ''I''d better <b>do</b>'' (<i>not</i> to do).\n#tab# It might rain. We''d better <b>take</b> an umbrella. (<i>not</i> We''d better to take)\n\n\nB) <b>Had better</b> and <b>should</b>\n\n<b>Had better</b> is similar to <b>should</b> but not exactly the same. We use <b>had better</b> only for specific situation (not for things in general). You can use <b>should</b> in all types of situations to give an opinion or give advise:\n#tab# It''s late. You''<b>d better go</b>. / You <b>should go</b>. (a specific situation)\n#tab# You''re always at home. You <b>should go</b> out more often. (in general - <i>not</i> ''had better go'')\n\nAlso, with <b>had better</b>, there is always a danger or a problem if you don''t follow the advice.\n<b>Should</b> only means ''it is a good thing to do''.

It''s time <b>we went</b> home.\nHere we use past (<b>went</b>), but the meaning is present, <i>not</i> past:\n#tab# It''s 10 o''clock and he''s still in bed. <b>It''s time he got</b> up. (<i>not</i> it''s time he gets up)\n\n<b>It''s time you did</b> something = you should have already done it or started it. We often use this stucture to criricise or to complane:\n#tab# <b>It''s time</b> the children <b>were</b> in bed. It''s long after bedtime.\n#tab# You''e very selfish. <b>It''s time</b> you <b>realised</b> that you''re not the most important person in the world.\n\nYou can also say <b>It''s about time</b> ... .

This tells us that she <i>doesn''t</i> know his number. She imagining the situation. The  <i>real</i> situation is that she doesn''t know the number.  \n<hr />\nWhen you imagine a situation like this, you use <b>if</b> + <i>past</i> (<b>if I knew</b> / <b>if</b> you <b>were</b> / <b>if</b> we <b>didn''t</b> etc. ).\nBut the meaning is present, <i>not</i> past:\n#tab# Tom would read more <b>if</b> he <b>had</b> more time.

(44, 'A) <b>I was offered ... / we were given ...</b>\n\nSome verbs can have two objects. For example, <b>give</b>:\n#tab# Somebody gave <u>the police</u> <u style="border-bottom: 1px solid #000">the information</u>. (= Somebody gave the information to the police)\n\n\nSo it is possible to make two passive sentences:\n#tab# <u>The police</u> were given the information.\n#tab# <u style=''border-bottom: 1px solid #000''>The information</u> was given to the Police.\n\nOther verbs wich can have two oblects are:\n#tab# <b>ask &nbsp; &nbsp; offer &nbsp; &nbsp; pay& show &nbsp; &nbsp; nbsp; &nbsp; teach &nbsp; &nbsp; tell</b>\n\nWhen we use these verbs in the passive, most often we begim with the <i>person</i>:\n#tab# <b>I was offered</b> the job, but I refused it.

(<i>not</i> Where are you born?) <i>past</i>\n<i>but</i>\n#tab# How many babies <b>are born</b> every day? <i>present</i>\n\n\nD) <b>Get</b>\n\nYou can use <b>get</b> instead of <b>be</b> in the passive:\n#tab# There was a fight at the party, but nobody <b>got hurt</b>.

For example, you cannot use <b>get</b> in the following sentences:\n#tab# Jill <b>is liked</b> by everybody. (<i>not</i> gets liked - this is not ''hapenning'')\n#tab# He was a mystery man. Very little <b>was known</b> about him.

It''<b>s supposed to be</b> good. (= it is said to be good)\n#tab# Mark <b>is supposed to have hit</b> a policeman, but I don''t believe it.\n\nBut sometimes <b>supposed to</b> has a different meaning. We use <b>supposed to</b> to say what is inteded, arrenged or expected. Often this is different from the real situation:\n#tab# The plan <b>is supposed to be</b> a secret, but everybody seems to know about it.

(46, 'A) Study this example situation:\n\nThe roof of Lisa''s house was damaged in a storm.\nYesterday a workman came and repaired it.\n\nLisa <b>had</b> the roof <b>repaired</b> yesterday.\n\nThis means: Lisa arranged for somebody else to repair the roof. \nShe didn''t repair it herself.\n<hr />\nWe use <b>have something done</b> to say that we arranged for somebody else to do something for us.\nCompare:\n#tab# Lisa <b>repaired</b> the roof. (= she repaired it herself)\n#tab# Lisa <b>had</b> the roof <b>repaired</b>. (= she arranged for somebody else to repair it)\n\n#tab# ''Did you <b>make</b> those curtains yourself?'' ''Yes, I enjoy making things.''\n#tab# ''Did you <b>have</b> thise curtains <b>made</b>?'' ''No, I made them myself.''\n\n\nB) Be careful with word order. The <i>past participle</i> (<b>repaired</b> / <b>cut</b> etc.) is after the <i>object</i>:\n<b>have</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u>object</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i><b>past participle</b></i>\n\nLisa <b>had</b> <u>the roof</u> <i><b>repaired</b></i> yesterday.\nWhere did you <b>have</b> <u>your hair</u> <i><b>cut</b></i>?\nYour hair looks nuce.

(= have the roof repaired)\n#tab# I think you should <b>get your hair cut</b> really short.\n\n\nD) Sometimes <b>have something done</b> has a different meaning. For example:\n\n#tab# Paul and Karen <b>had all their money stolen</b> while they were on holiday.\nThis does not mean that they arranged for somebody to steal their money. ''They <b>had all their money stolen</b>'' meand only: ''All their money was stolen from them.''\n\nWith this meaning, we use <b>have something done</b> to say that something happens to somebody or their belongigns. Usually what happens is not nice:\n#tab# Gary <b>had</b> his nose <b>broken</b> in a fight. (= his nose was broken)\n#tab# Have you ever <b>had</b> your passport <b>stolen</b>?\n\n\n\n', 46),
(47, 'A) Study this example situation:\n\n#tab# You want to tell somebody what Paul said.\n#tab# There are two ways of doing this:\n \n#tab# You can repeat Paul''s words (<i>direct</i> speech):\n#tab# Paul said, ''<b>I''m feeling ill</b>.''\n\n#tab# Or you can use <i>reported</i> speech:\n#tab# Paul said <b>that he was felling ill</b>.\n\nCompare:\n<i>direct</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Paul said, ''<b>I am</b> feeling ill.''\n<i>reported</i> Paul said that <b>he was</b> felling ill.\n<hr />\n\nB) When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past (Paul <b>said</b> that ... / I <b>told</b> her that.. etc.).\nThe rest of sentence is usually past too:\n#tab# Paul <b>said</b> that he <b>was feeling</b> ill.\n#tab# I <b>told</b> Lisa I <b>didn''t have</b> any money,\n\nYou can leave out <b>that</b>. So you can say:\n#tab# Paul <b>said that</b> he was feeling ill. <i>or</i> Paul <b>said</b> he was filling ill.\n\nIn general, the <i>present</i> form in direct speech changes to the <i>past</i> form in reported speech:\n\nam / is &rarr; <b>was</b>\nare &rarr; <b>ware</b>\n\ndo / does &rarr; <b>did</b>\nhave / has &rarr; <b>had</b>\n\nwill &rarr; <b>would</b>\ncan &rarr; <b>could</b>\n\nwant/like/know/go etc. &rarr; <b>wanted/liked/knew/went</b> etc.\n\nCompare direct speech and reported speech:\n\nYou met Jenny. Here are some of the things she said in <i>direct</i> speech:\n#tab# ''My parents <b>are</b> very well.''\n#tab# ''I''<b>m</b> going to learn to drive.''\n#tab# ''I <b>want</b> to buy a car.''\n#tab# ''John <b>has</b> a new job.''\n#tab# ''I <b>can''t</b> come to the party on Friday.''\n#tab# ''I <b>don''t</b> have much free time.''\n#tab# ''I''<b>m</b> going away for a few days.''\n#tab# ''I''<b>ll</b> phone you when I <b>get</b> back.''\n\nLater you tell somebody what Jenny said.\nYou use <i>reported</i> speech:\n#tab# Jenny said that her parents <b>were</b> very well.\n#tab# She said that she <b>was</b> going to learn to drive.\n#tab# She said that she <b>wanted</b> to buy a car.\n#tab# She said that John <b>had</b> a new job.\n#tab# She said that she <b>couldn''t</b> come ti the party on Friday.\n#tab# She said that she <b>didn''t</b> have much free time.\n#tab# She said that she <b>was</b> going away for a few days.\n#tab# and <b>would</b> phone me when she <b>got</b> back.\n<hr />\n\nC) The <i>past simple</i> (<b>did / saw / knew</b> etc.) can usually stay the same in report speech, or you can chnge it to the <i>past perfect</i>:\n\n#tab# <i>direct</i>: Paul said: ''I <b>woke</b> up filling ill, so I <b>didn''t go</b> to work.''\n\n#tab# <i>reported</i>: Paul said (that) he <b>woke</b> up feeling ill, so he <b>didn''t go</b> to work.\n<i>or</i>#tab# Paul said (that) he <b>had woken</b> up feeling ill, so he <b>hadn''t gone</b> to work.\n\n\n\n', 47),
(48, 'A) It is not always neccessary to change verb in reported speech. If you report something and the situation <i>hasn''t changed</i>, you do not need to change the verb to the past:\n\n#tab# <i>direct</i> Paul said, ''My new job <b>is</b> very interesting.''\n#tab# <i>reported</i> Paul said that his job <b>is</b> very interesting.\n#tab# (The situation hasn''t changed. His job <b>is</b> still interesting.)\n\n#tab# <i>direct</i> Helen said, ''<b>I want</b> to go to New York next year.''\n#tab# <i>reported</i> Helen told me that <b>she wants</b> to go to New York next year.\n#tab# (Helen still wants to go to New York next year.)\n\n\nYou can also change the verb to the past:\n#tab# Paul said that his new job <b>was</b> very interesting.\n#tab# Helen told me that she <b>wanted</b> to go to New York next year,\n\nBut if you are reporting a finished situation, you <b>must</b> use a past verb:\n#tab# Paul left the room sudddenly. He said <b>he had</b> to go. (<i>not</i> has to go)\n\n\nB) You need to use a past form when there is a difference between what was said and what is really true.\nFor example:\nYou met Sonia a few days ago.\nShe said: ''<b>Joe is in hospital</b>.'' (<i>direct speech</i>)\n\nLateer that day you meet Joe in the street. You say:\n''I didn''t expect to see you, Joe. Sonia said you <b>were</b> in hospital.''\n(<i>not</i> ''Sonia said you are in hospital'', because clearly he is not)\n\n\nC) <b>Say</b> and <b>tell</b>\n\nIf you say <i>who</i> somebody is talking to, use <b>tell</b>:\n#tab# Sonia <b>told me</b> that you were in hospital. (<i>not</i> Sonia said me)\n#tab# What did you <b>tell the police</b>? (<i>not</i> said the police)\n\nOtherwise use <b>say</b>:\n#tab# Sonia <b>said</b> that you were in hospital. (<i>not</i> Sonia told that ... )\n#tab# What did you <b>say</b>?\n\nBut you can ''<b>say</b> something <b>to</b> somebody'':\n#tab# Ann <b>said</b> goodbye <b>to</b> me and left. (<i>not</i> Ann said me goodbye)\n#tab# What did you <b>say to</b> the police?\n\n\nD) <b>Tell /  ask</b> somebody <b>to</b> do something:\n\nWe also use the infinitive (to do / to stay etc.) in report speech, especiallywith <b>tell</b> and <b>ask</b> (for oreders and requests):\n\n#tab# <i>direct</i> ''<b>Stay</b> in bed for a few days,'' the doctor said to me.\n#tab# <i>reported</i> The doctor <b>told me to</b> stay in bed for a few days.\n\n#tab# <i>direct</i> ''<b>Don''t shout</b>,'' I said to Jim.\n#tab# <i>reported</i> I <b>told Jim not to</b> shout.\n\n#tab# <i>direct</i> ''Please <b>don''t tell</b> anybody what happened,'' Jackie said to me.\n#tab# <i>reported</i> Jackie <b>asked me not to</b> tell anybody what had happened.\n\nYou can also say ''Somebody <b>said</b> (not) <b>to</b> do something'':\n#tab# Jackie <b>said</b> not <b>to tell anyone</b>. (<i>but not</i> Jackie said me)\n\n\n\n', 48),
(49, 'A) In questions we usually put the subject after the first verb:\n#tab# <i>subject &nbsp; &nbsp; + &nbsp; &nbsp; verb</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>verb&nbsp; &nbsp; + &nbsp; &nbsp; subject</i>\n\n#tab# Tom will &rarr; Will Tom? &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Wil Toml</b> be here tomorrow?\n#tab# You have &rarr; Have you? &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Have you</b>been working hard?\n#tab# the house was &rarr; Was the house? &nbsp; &nbsp; When <b>was the house</b> built?\n\nRemember that the subjects comes after the <i>first</i> verb:\n#tab# <b>Is Catherine</b> working today? (<i>not</i> Is working Catherine)\n\n\nB) In <i>present simple</i> questions, we use <b>do / does</b>:\n\n#tab# you live &rarr; <b>do</b> you live? &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Do</b> you <b>live</b> here?\n#tab# the film begins &rarr; <b>does</b> film begin? &nbsp; &nbsp; What time <b>does</b> the film <b>begin</b>?\n\n\nIn <i>past simple</i> questions, we use <b>did</b>:\n#tab# you sold &rarr; <b>did</b> you sell? &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Did</b> you <b>sell</b> your car?\n#tab# the train stopped &rarr; <b>did</b> the train stop? &nbsp; &nbsp; Why <b>did</b> the train <b>stop</b>?\n\nBut do not use <b>do / does / did</b> if <b>who / what</b> is the subject of the sentence. Compare:\n\n#tab# <u>who</u> <i>object</i>\n#tab# Emma phoned <u>somebody</u>.\n#tab# <u>Who</u> <b>did</b> Emma <b>phoned</b>.\n\n#tab# <u>Somebody</u> phoned Emma.\n#tab# <u>Who</u> <b>phoned</b> Emma.\n\nIn these examples, <b>who / what</b> etc. is the <i>subject</i>:\n#tab# <b>Who wants</b> something to eat? (<i>not</i> Who does want)\n#tab# <b>What happened</b> to you last night? (<i>not</i> What does happened)\n#tab# <b>How many people came</b> to the meeting? (<i>not</i> did come)\n#tab# <b>Which bus goes</b> to the center? (<i>not</i> does go)\n\n\nC) Note the position of prepositions in questions beginning <b>Who / What / Which / Where ...</b>?):\n\n#tab# <b>Who</b> do you want to speak <b>to</b>?\n#tab# <b>Which</b> job has Ann applied <b>for</b>?\n#tab# <b>What</b> was the weather  <b>like</b> yesterday?\n#tab# <b>Where</b> are you <b>from</b>?\n\nYou can use <i>preposition</i> + <b>whom</b> in normal style:\n#tab# <b>To whom</b> do you want to speak?\n\n\nD) <b>Isn''t it ... ? / DIdn''t you ... ?</b> etc. (negative questions)\n\nWe use negative questions especially to show surprise:\n#tab# <b>Didn''t you</b> hear the doorbell? I rang it three times.\nor when we expect the listener to agree with us:\n#tab# ''<b>Haven''t we</b> met somewhere before?'' ''Yes, I think we have.''\n\nNote the meaning of <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> in answer to negative questions:\n#tab# <b>Don''t you</b> want to go to the party? <b>Yes</b>. (= Yes, I want to go) \n#tab# <b>Don''t you</b> want to go to the party? <b>No</b>. (= No, I don''t want to go) \n\nNote the word order in negative questions begining <b>Why ...</b>? :\n#tab# <b>Why don''t we</b> go out for a meal? <b>Yes</b>. (<i>not</i> Why we don''t go)\n#tab# <b>Why wasn''t Mary</b> at work yesterday? <b>Yes</b>. (<i>not</i> Why Mary wasn''t) \n\n\n\n', 49),
(50, 'A) <b>Do you know where ... ?</b> / <b>I don''t know why ... ?</b> / <b>Could you tell me what ... ?</b> etc.\n\nWe say: #tab# Where <b>has Tome</b> gone?\n<i>but</i> #tab# <b>Do you know</b> where <b>Tom has</b> gone? \n#tab# (<i>not</i> Do you know where has Tom gone?)\n\nWhen the question (<b>Where has Tom gone</b>?) is part of a longer sentence (<b>Do you know ... </b>? / <b>I don''t know ...</b> / <b>Can you tell me ... </b>? etc. ), the word order changes.\nWe say:\n\n#tab# What time <b>is it</b>? <i>but</i>\n#tab# <b>Do you know</b> what time <b>it is</b>?\n\n#tab# Who <b>are those people</b>? <i>but</i>\n#tab# <b>I don''t  know</b> who <b>those people are</b>.\n\n#tab# Where <b>can I find</b> Linda? <i>but</i>\n#tab# <b>Can you tell me</b> where <b>I can</b> find Linda?\n\n#tab# How much <b>will it</b> cost? <i>but</i>\n#tab# <b>Do you have any idea</b> how much <b>it will cost</b>?\n<hr />\nBe careful with <b>do / does / did</b> questions. We say:\n#tab# What time <b>does the film begin</b>? <i>but</i>\n#tab# <b>Do you know</b> what time <b>the film begin</b>?\n\n#tab# What <b>do you mean</b>? <i>but</i>\n#tab# <b>Please explain</b> what <b>you mean</b>?\n\n#tab# Why <b>did she leave</b> early? <i>but</i>\n#tab# <b>I wonder</b> why <b>she left</b> early?\n<hr />\nUse <b>if</b> or <b>whether</b> wheere there in ni question word (<b>what</b>, <b>why</b> etc.):\n#tab# Did anybody see you? <i>but</i>\n#tab# Do you know <b>if</b> anybody saw you? <i>or</i>\n#tab# ... <b>whether</b> anybody saw you?\n<hr />\n\nB) <b>He asked me where ... </b> (reported questions)\n\nThe same changes in word order happen in reported questions. Compare:\n\n<i>direct</i> #tab# The police officer said to us, ''Where <b>are you going</b>?''\n<i>reported</i> #tab# The police officer asked us where <b>we were going</b>?\n\n<i>direct</i> #tab# Clare said, ''What time <b>do the bank close</b>?''\n<i>reported</i> #tab# Clare wanted to know what time <b>the banks closed</b>?\n\nIn reported speech the verbs usually changes to the past (<b>were, closed</b> etc.).\nStudy these examples. You had an interview for job and these were some of the questions the interviewer asked you:\n\n#tab# ''<b>Are you</b> willing to travel?''\n#tab# ''What <b>do you do</b> in your spare time?''\n#tab# ''How long <b>have you been</b> working in your present job?''\n#tab# ''Why <b>did you apply</b> for the job?''\n#tab# ''<b>Can you speak</b> any foreigh languages?''\n#tab# ''<b>Do you have</b> a driving licence?''\n\nLater you tell a friend what the interviewer asked you. You use <i>reported</i> speech:\n#tab# She asked if (<i>orwhether</i>) <b>I was</b> willing to travel.\n#tab# She wanted to know what <b>I did</b> in my spare time.\n#tab# She asked how long <b>I had</b> been working in my present job.\n#tab# She asked why <b>I had</b> applied for the job. (<i>or</i> ... why I <b>applied</b>)\n#tab# She wanted to know if <b>I could</b> speak any foreigh languages.\n#tab# She asked if (<i>orwhether</i>) <b>I had</b> a driving licence.\n\n\n\n\n', 50),
(51, 'A) In each of these sentences there is <u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">auxiliary verb</u> and <u>main</u> verb:\n\n#tab# I <u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">have</u> <u>lost</u> my key.\n\n#tab# She <u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">can''t</u> <u>come</u> to the party.\n\n#tab# The hotel <u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">was</u> <u>built</u> ten years ago.\n\n#tab# Where <u style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">do</u> you <u>live</u>?\n\n\nIn these examples <b>help/can''t/was/do</b> are auxiliary (= helping) verbs.\n\nYou can use an auxiliary verbs when you don''t want to repeat something:\n#tab# ''Have you locked the door?'' ''Yes, I have.''  (= I have <i>loked the door</i>)\n#tab# George wasn''t working, but Janet <b>was</b>. (= Janet was <i>working</i>)\n#tab# She could lend me the money, but she <b>won''t</b>. (= She won''t <i>lend me the money</i>)\n\nUse <b>do / does / did</b> for the present and past simple:\n#tab# ''Do you like onion?'' ''Yes, I <b>do</b>'' (= I <i>like onion</i>)\n#tab# ''Does SImon live in London?'' ''He, <b>did</b>, but he <b>doesn''t</b> any more.''\n\nYou can use auxiliary verbs to deny what somebody says (= say it is not true):\n#tab# ''You''re sitting in my place.'' ''No, I''<b>m not</b>.'' (I''m not <i>sitting in your place</i>)\n#tab# ''You didn''t lock the door before you left.'' ''Yes, I <b>did</b>.'' (= I <i>looked the door</i>)\n\n\nB) We use <b>have you?</b> / <b>isn''t she</b> / <b>do they?</b> etc. to show interest in what somebody has said or to show surprise:\n#tab# ''I''ve just seen Simen.'' ''Oh, <b>have you</b>? How is he?''\n#tab# ''Liz isn''t very well today.'' ''Oh, <b>isn''t she</b>? What''s wrong with her?''\n#tab# ''It rained every day during our holiday.'' ''<b>Did it</b>? What a pity!''\n#tab# ''Jim and Nora are getting married.'' ''<b>Are they</b>? Really?''\n\n\nC) We use auxiliary verbs with <b>so</b> and <b>neither</b>:\n#tab# ''I''m feeling tired.'' ''<b>So am I</b>.'' (= I''m feeling tired too)\n#tab# ''I never read newspaper.'' ''<b>Neither do I</b>.'' (= I never read newspaper either)\n#tab# Sue hasn''t got a car and <b>niether has Martin</b>.\n\nNote the word order after <b>so</b> and <b>niether</b> (verb before subject):\n#tab# I passed the exam and so <b>did Paul</b>. (<i>not</i> so Paul did)\n\nInstead of <b>niether</b>, you can use <b>nor</b>. You acn also use <b>not ... either</b>:\n#tab# ''I don''t know.'' ''<b>Niether</b> do I.'' <i>or</i> ''<b>Nor</b> do I.'' <i>or</i> ''I don''<b>t either</b>.''\n\n\nD) <b>I think so / I hope so</b> etc.\n\nAfter some verb you can use <b>so</b> when you don''t want to repeat something:\n#tab# ''Are those people Elglish?'' ''<b>I think so</b>.'' (= I think <i>they are English</i>)\n#tab# ''Will you be at home this evening?'' ''<b>I expect so</b>'' (= I expect <i>I''ll be at home...</i>)\n#tab# ''Do you think Kate has been invited to the party?'' ''<b>I suppose so</b>.''\n\nIn the same way we say: <b>I hope so</b>, <b>I guess so</b> and <b>I''m afraid so</b>.\n\nThe usual negative forms are:\nI think so / I expect so &rarr; <b>I don''t think so / I don''t expect so</b>\nI hope so / I''m afraid so / I guess so &rarr; <b>I hope not / I''m afraid not / I guess not </b>\nI suppose so &rarr; <b>I don''t supose so</b> <i>or</i> <b>I suppose not</b>\n\n#tab# ''Is that woman American?'' ''<b>I think so. / I don''t think so.</b>''\n#tab# ''Do you think it will rain?'' ''<b>I hope so. / I hope not. </b>'' (<i>NOT</i> I don''t hope so)\n \n\n', 51),
(52, 'A) Study these examples:\n#tab# You haven''t seen Kate today, <b>have you</b>?\n#tab# No, I''m afraid not.\n\n#tab# I was good film, <b>wasn''t it</b>?\n#tab# It was great.\n\n<b>Have you?</b> and <b>wasn''t it</b> are <i>question tags</i> (= mini-questions that we often put on the end of a sentece in spoken English). \nIn question tags, we use an auxiliary verbs (<b>have</b> / <b>was</b> / <b>will</b> etc.).\nWe use <b>do</b> / <b>does</b> / <b>did</b> for the present and past simple:\n#tab# ''Karen plays the piano, <b>doen''t</b> she?'' ''Well, yes, but not very well.''\n#tab# ''You didn''t lock the door, <b>did</b> you?'' ''No, I forgot.''\n\n\nB) Normally we use a <i>negative</i> question tag after a <i>positive</i> sentence:\n#tab# Kate <b>will</b> be here soon, <b>won''t she</b>?\n#tab# There <b>was</b> a lot of traffic, <b>wasn''t there</b>?\n#tab# Michael <b>should</b> pass the exam, <b>souldn''t he</b>?\n\n... and a <i>positive</i> question tag after  <i>negative</i> sentence:\n#tab# Kate <b>won''t</b> be late, <b>will she</b>?\n#tab# They <b>don''t</b> like us, <b>do they</b>?\n#tab# You <b>haven''t go</b> a car, <b>have you</b>?\n\nNotice the meaning of <b>yes</b> and <b>no</b> in answer to a negative sentence:\n#tab# You''re <b>not</b> going out today, <b>are you</b>?\n#tab# <b>Yes</b>. (= Yes, I am going out.)\n#tab# <b>No</b>. (= No, I am not going out.)\n\n\nC) The meaning of a question tag depends on how you say it. If your voice goes <i>down</i> &darr;, you are not really asking a question; you are only inviting the listener to agree with you:\n#tab# ''It''s a nice day, <b>isn''t &darr; it</b>?'' ''Yes, beautiful.''\n#tab# ''Tim doesn''t look well today, <b>does &darr; he</b>?'' ''No, he looks very tired.''\n#tab# She is very funny. She''s got a great sence of humour, <b>hasn''t &darr; she</b>?\n\nBut if the voice goes <i>UP</i> &uarr; it is a real question:\n#tab# ''You haven''t seen Lisa today, <b>have &uarr; you</b>?'' ''No, I''m afraid haven''t.''\n#tab# (= Have you by chance seen Lisa today?)\n\nYou can use a <i>negative sentence + positive tag</i> to  ask for thing or infrmation, or to ask somebody to do something. The voice goes <i>up</i> &uarr; at the end of the tag in sentences like these:\n#tab# ''You haven''t got a pen, <b>have &uarr; you</b>?'' ''Yes, here you are.''\n#tab# ''You couldn''t do me a favour, <b>could &uarr; you</b>?'' ''It depends what it is.''\n#tab# ''You don''t know where Karen is, <b>do &uarr; you</b>?'' ''Sorry, I have no idea.''\n\n\nD) After <b>Let''s .. </b> the question tag is <b>shall we</b>:\n#tab# <b>Let''s</b> go for a walk, <b>shall &uarr; we</b>?\n\nAfter <b>Don''t .. </b>, the question tag is <b>will you</b>?\n#tab# <b>Don''t</b> be late, <b>will &darr; you</b>? (the voice goes <i>down</i>)\n\nAfter <b>I''m ... </b>, the question tag is <b>aren''t I</b>?  (= am I not):\n#tab# ''I''m right, <b>aren''t I</b>?''  ''Yes, you are.''\n\n\n', 52);

(61, 'A) Study this example situation:\n\nLisa is American, but she lives in Britain.
